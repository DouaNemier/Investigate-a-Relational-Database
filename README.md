🧩 Investigate a Relational Database

📊 Project Overview

This project was completed as part of the Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree.
The goal was to explore a relational database using SQL to extract useful insights from real-world data.
By querying multiple tables, I investigated patterns, relationships, and summaries within the dataset.
